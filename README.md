Title: Used an image called cdc logo.png to convey title because I wanted to use the Coeur d'Con logo. 
Navigation bar: links to the Coeur d'con website in the Bangers font
Introduction: The aim of this project is to highlight the Artists that have participated in Coeur d'Con (a library comic con that sees 2000 visitors every year) over the past 5 years. 
Cards: Used Bootstrap to create cards that feature CDC artists from previous years. I used 6 different .png as placeholders for examples of their artwork and used names taken from the NATO alphabet as placeholders for names. I changed the color of the buttons and the scroll over color. The links do not exist but could be easily added. 
Technologies: Bootstrap 4 and a google font
